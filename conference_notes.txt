CONFERENCE PRESENTATION NOTES: MULTI-ROBOT COVERAGE PATH PLANNING (MCPP)

1. BASELINE ARCHITECTURE: "Single Path Split"
"A Turn-minimizing Algorithm For Multi-robot Coverage Path Planning" by Junjie Lu et al. (2022)."
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Concept:**
The baseline approach simplifies the multi-robot problem by treating it as a single-robot problem first.
1.  **Global Path Generation:** It generates one giant coverage path that visits every cell in the grid (using a Spanning Tree Coverage algorithm).
2.  **Segmentation:** It cuts this giant path into 'k' equal-length segments.
3.  **Assignment:** Each robot is assigned one segment.

**Limitations:**
*   **Arbitrary Boundaries:** The split points are determined purely by path count, not by the geometry of the room. This results in regions that are jagged, irregular, and intertwined.
*   **High Turn Count:** Because the regions are oddly shaped, robots are forced to make frequent turns to stay on their assigned path.
*   **Inefficient Motion:** In real-world robotics, turning takes time and energy (deceleration -> turn -> acceleration). A path with 500 turns is significantly slower than a path with 300 turns, even if the distance is the same.

2. OPTIMIZED ARCHITECTURE: "Divide and Conquer" (RCB + Biased MST)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Concept:**
Your optimized approach solves the partitioning problem *before* the path planning problem.
1.  **Recursive Coordinate Bisection (RCB):** You recursively split the grid into two halves using the median line of the longest axis. This is repeated until you have 'k' balanced regions.
2.  **Biased Spanning Tree (BST):** Inside each region, you generate a path. Crucially, you use a "Biased" Minimum Spanning Tree that makes horizontal or vertical connections "cheaper" than turning. This forces the path to form long, straight scanning lines (boustrophedon motion).

**Advantages:**
*   **Geometric Coherence:** Robots are assigned to compact, rectangular-like zones.
*   **Turn Minimization:** The algorithm explicitly optimizes for straight-line motion.
*   **Scalability:** Solving 'k' small path planning problems is faster than solving one giant one.

3. RESULTS COMPARISON
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Based on your experiment (30x20 Grid, 6 Robots):

*   **Baseline (Stop & Turn):** 834.00s Total Time (492 Turns)
*   **Optimized (Stop & Turn):** 628.00s Total Time (317 Turns) -> ~25% Faster
*   **Optimized (Ackermann):** 284.49s Total Time -> **~66% Faster**

**Interpretation:**
While the "Makespan" (distance) is similar, the *quality* of the path is vastly superior.
1.  **Path Planning Impact:** Reducing turns alone (Stop & Turn model) saves ~25% time.
2.  **Kinematic Impact:** Using an agile robot (Ackermann) on the optimized path saves ~66% time compared to the baseline.

4. KINEMATIC MODELING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The system now evaluates paths under four distinct motion models:
*   **Stop & Turn:** Robot stops completely to rotate (Baseline).
*   **Smooth Turn:** Robot turns while moving (radius constrained).
*   **Differential:** Tank-like turning.
*   **Ackermann:** Car-like steering (fastest for smooth paths).
